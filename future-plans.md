# ðŸš€ Future Plans

Eventually, we plan to launch our first major development project which will be a series of games that will utilize our NFT projects, as well as our own Cryptocurrency Token on the Cronos chain. We have tentatively named this project "LSU". It will be easy, secure, and inexpensive, and a portion of the proceeds will go to the [investment vault](the-investment-vault.md). LSU will become the next major chapter of the DACC project, and we can't wait to share it with the rest of the community.\
\
More details about these plans will be released at a later date.
