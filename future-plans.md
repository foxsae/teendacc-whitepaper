# ðŸš€ Future Plans

After TeenDACC reaches 100% mint, and NFT staking has been enabled, the team will launch a swag store that will feature a 10% discount for customers who hold both DACC and TeenDACC NFTs.&#x20;

After that, we plan to launch our first major development project which we have tentatively named "LSU". It will be easy, secure, and inexpensive, and a portion of the proceeds will go to the [investment vault](the-investment-vault.md). LSU will become the next major chapter of the TeenDACC project, and we can't wait to share it with the rest of the community.

The final stage of the TeenDACC project will be to automate the entire process so that it no longer requires any human intervention to manage its funds or to make payouts to staked holders. Once the goals have been reached of reducing the total TeenDACC supply to 3000 and increasing the value of the investment vault to more than $300,000 USD we will redesign the toolchain and automate the entire process. Once that has been done we will consider the TeenDACC project to be feature complete, and essentially finished.  \
