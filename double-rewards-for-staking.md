# ðŸ”’ Double Rewards for Staking

TeenDACC and Degen Ape Cronos Club (DACC) will have a combination reward system for staking, part of the rewards will need to be harvested, and part of the rewards will be airdropped.&#x20;

To receive any staking rewards you will be required to stake your NFT on the CandyCity [NFT Partner Staking](https://candycity.finance/nfts/staking/partner?chainId=25) platform. Once your NFT is staked into one of these pools you will be able to harvest daily rewards paid out in Candy tokens which will be generated from the Candy-farm investments.

But there will also be a **second** reward. Staked NFTs will also receive a weekly **airdrop** of Cros tokens generated from the Cros-farm investments.\
\
Not all of the interest that is generated will be paid out to the staking pools, or by the airdrops. A portion of the interest will be withheld and compounded, the amount withheld will be based on the total combined value of the vault.

| Value of the vault | Interest paid out | Interest compounded |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| After Mint         | 50%               | 45%                 |
| USD 100,000+       | 60%               | 35%                 |
| USD 200,000+       | 70%               | 25%                 |
| USD 300,000+       | 95%               | 0%                  |

A 5% portion of the interest will also be withheld and used for TeenDACC buy-back-and-burn until the total supply of TeenDACC is reduced from 7777 to 3000, and afterward, this 5% portion of interest will be used for future developments.&#x20;

There will also be a 5% portion of the vault entitled Experimental Investments which will be used for alternative strategies and future developments.

The CandyCity NFT staking platform does not lock NFTs, holders will be free to move their NFTs into and out of the staking platform as they see fit.

## What type of coins will be paid to staked holders?

Candy-token, and Cros-token, but we may decide to add others later.

## Staking Degen Ape Cronos Club (DACC)

DACC is a royalty-based NFT that airdrops 75% of the royalties it earns from secondary markets back to holders every week. DACC holders will still continue to receive this royalty payment airdrop even when they are staked into the CandyCity staking platform. So for staked DACC holders, there will actually be three different rewards sent to them every week: Candy, Cros, and WCRO.&#x20;
