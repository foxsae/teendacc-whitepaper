# ðŸ”’ Double Rewards for Staking

TeenDACC and Degen Ape Cronos Club (DACC) will have a combination reward system for staking, part of the rewards will need to be harvested, and part of the rewards will be airdropped.&#x20;

To receive any staking rewards you will be required to stake your NFT on the CandyCity [NFT Partner Staking](https://candycity.finance/nfts/staking/partner?chainId=25) platform. Once your NFT is staked into one of these pools you will be able to harvest daily rewards paid out in tokens which will be generated from the Liquidity Pool farm investments.

But there will also be a **second** reward. Staked NFTs will also receive a weekly **airdrop** of Cros tokens generated from the Cros-farm investments.\
\
Not all of the interest that is generated will be paid out to the staking pools, or by the airdrops. A portion of the interest will be withheld and compounded, the amount withheld will be based on the total combined value of the vault.

| Value of the vault | Interest paid out | Interest compounded |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| After Mint         | 50%               | 40%                 |
| USD 100,000+       | 60%               | 30%                 |
| USD 150,000+       | 70%               | 20%                 |
| USD 200,000+       | 90%               | 0%                  |

A 10% portion of the interest will also be withheld at all times and used for TeenDACC buy-back-and-burn for the first year.&#x20;

After one year 5% will continue to be used for BB\&B and the other 5% will become a management fee.

Once the total supply of TeenDACC has been reduced from 7777 to 3000, the 5% portion used for BB\&B will become team development funds. &#x20;

There will also be a 5% portion of the vault investment entitled Experimental Investments which will be used for alternative strategies and future developments.

The CandyCity NFT staking platform does not lock NFTs, holders will be free to move their NFTs into and out of the staking platform as they see fit.

## What type of coins will be paid to staked holders?

Candy-token, and Cros-token, but we may decide to add others later.

## Staking DACC NFTs

DACC is a royalty-rewards NFT,  each week the Council airdrops 75% of the royalties that DACC has earned from secondary markets back to DACC holders. DACC holders will still continue to receive this royalty payment airdrop even when they have staked their DACC into the CandyCity staking platform.

## DACC NFT Isolation

The DACC Council has created a mechanism to reduce the total supply of DACC, which is called the Isolation Wallet. Since the DACC contract was not written to include a burning mechanism, the Council has decided to do the next best thing: Isolate them. \
\
The DACC Council currently receives 25% of the secondary market royalties for DACC, and the Council has agreed to use these royalties to buy DACC off the markets and send them into an isolation wallet. Once in the isolation wallet, those DACC will no longer be able to receive any further royalties, they will not be bought or sold on any markets, and they will not be staked. Once in the isolation wallet those DACC are effectively dead NFTs.

The Council agrees to continue to isolate DACC NFTs until the total supply of active DACC NFTs has been reduced from 7777 down to 4777, once that goal has been reached, the 25% portion of royalties will be re-assigned back to the Council.
