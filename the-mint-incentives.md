# üèÜ The Mint Incentives

## The main incentive for minting TeenDACC are the weekly rewards that are paid to holders.&#x20;

## However, we offer additional incentives to those who mint while the minting lasts.&#x20;

## 1. Free T-Shirt for the top 10 holders

When the TeenDACC mint is concluded, the top 10 holders will receive a coupon for a free t-shirt (including shipping) from our store partner BuddieLabs.&#x20;

## 2. Every 100 mints there will be 5 random draw winners

Each winner will receive: 1 TeenDACC + 100 Cro

## 3. T-Shirt design contest

After the mint has finished we will hold a t-shirt design contest. The winner will be chosen by a Discord vote, and the prize will be a free t-shirt.

## 4. Other Incentives

We will also periodically offer other incentives and collaborations with other projects.
