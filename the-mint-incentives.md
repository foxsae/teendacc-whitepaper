# üèÜ The Mint Incentives

## 1. Free T-Shirt for the top 10 holders

When the TeenDACC mint is concluded, the top 10 holders will receive a coupon for a free t-shirt (including shipping) from our store partner BuddieLabs.&#x20;

## ~~2. Buy and mint an equal amount of DACC + TeenDACC~~

THIS INCENTIVE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL, AND HAS FINISHED, FOR NOW.

STAY TUNED FOR NEW UPDATES TO COME.\
\
This incentive will be back-dated to March 3rd 2023.&#x20;

This incentive is for people to buy an EQUAL amount of DACC to the amount of TeenDACC that they mint.&#x20;

The TeenDACC that can be earned is based on an escalating ratio. In addition to being an escalating reward, the majority of these rewards are also cumulative. The 1:1, 300 to 300 reward is the only non-cumulative reward. \
&#x20;

The more you mint + buy -> the more you will earn.&#x20;

| Ratios | Amounts    | Requirement                    | Reward    |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| 10:1   | 10 to 1    | buy 5 DACCs + mint 5 Teens     | 1 Teen    |
| 8:1    | 24 to 3    | buy 12 DACCs + mint 12 Teens   | 3 Teens   |
| 5:1    | 50 to 10   | buy 25 DACCs + mint 25 Teens   | 10 Teens  |
| 4:1    | 100 to 25  | buy 50 DACCs + mint 50 Teens   | 25 Teens  |
| 3:1    | 150 to 75  | buy 75 DACCs + mint 75 Teens   | 75 Teens  |
| 2:1    | 200 to 100 | buy 100 DACCs + mint 100 Teens | 100 Teens |
| 1:1    | 300 to 300 | buy 150 DACCs + mint 150 Teens | 300 Teens |

The total supply of free Teens that can be earned from this incentive will be capped at 1000. We have minted 1000 TeenDACC for this giveaway, if we burn through the first 1000 then we will consider if we should mint 1000 more to continue to offer this incentive.

## **3) Hammy Rumble Royale**&#x20;

Every Friday we will host a Rumble Royale on Discord in the `#üêπ‚îähammy` channel&#x20;

To participate at the beginning you must hold 5 TeenDACC and have the @TeenHammy role.&#x20;

To get the @TeenHammy role you must connect your wallet

There will be a window of about 24 hours to join the rumble.&#x20;

## 4) Mint a unique NFT

TeenDACC has 7 unique NFTs, 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666, 7777&#x20;

### **Prizes:**&#x20;

If you mint one of these unique NFTs you will be given a unique discord role. The role name, color, and icon can be something that you choose, within reason. The role will be tied to the NFT, so if you trade the NFT the new owner may choose to claim the unique role.

## 5) T-Shirt design contest

After the TeenDACC mint has concluded we will hold a t-shirt design contest. There will be a one-week window to submit designs for the contest. The top 3 finalists will be chosen by a Discord vote. Then a second vote will decide the winner from among the finalists.&#x20;
