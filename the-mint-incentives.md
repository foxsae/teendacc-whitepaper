# üèÜ The Mint Incentives

## 1. Free T-Shirt for the top 10 holders

When the TeenDACC mint is concluded, the top 10 holders will receive a coupon for a free t-shirt (including shipping) from our store partner BuddieLabs.&#x20;

## 2. Every 100 mints there will be 2 random draw winners

Each winner will receive 1 DACC + 1 TeenDACC + 100 Cro

## 3. Every Fri & Sat we will hold Rumble giveaways

To enter the Rumble you must hold the @TeenHammy Discord role.

## 4. Mint a unique NFT

TeenDACC has 7 unique NFTs: 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666, 7777&#x20;

If you mint one of these unique NFTs you will be given a unique discord role. The role name, color, and icon can be something that you choose, within reason. The role will be tied to the NFT, so the new owner may claim the unique role if you trade the NFT.

## 5. T-Shirt design contest

After the mint has finished we will hold a t-shirt design contest. The winner will be chosen by a Discord vote, and the prize will be a free t-shirt.

## 6. Other Incentives

We will also periodically offer other incentives and collaborations with other projects.
