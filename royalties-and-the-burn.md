# 🔥 Royalties and the Burn

The TeenDACC NFT will have a 10% secondary market royalty fee.

For the first year after TeenDACC is listed on secondary markets the team will run a vigorous buy-back-and-burn campaign to reduce the supply of TeenDACC.

| Royalties | Allocation                 |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| 100%      | Buy-back-and-burn TeenDACC |

| Interest | Allocation                 |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| 10%      | Buy-back-and-burn TeenDACC |

Every week, for one year, the team will use 100% of the royalty fees generated by secondary market sales, as well as 10% of the interest generated by the investment fund, to do BB\&B for TeenDACC to reduce its total supply. TeenDACC will be bought from the secondary markets, and permanently burned. Permanently reducing the total token supply.

After the one-year BB\&B period has ended the royalties will be shifted, 50% of royalties will be permanently sent into the investment vault, and the other 50% of royalties will go to the team.\
\
After the one-year BB\&B period has ended the 10% portion of interest will also be shifted, 5% will be permanently sent back into the investment vault to be compounded, and the other 5% will become an investment vault management fee.\
