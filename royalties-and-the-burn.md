# ðŸ”¥ Royalties and the Burn

The TeenDACC NFT will have a 10% secondary market royalty fee.

This fee will be allocated as follows:

| Royalties | Allocation                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 50%       | Sent to the Investment Vault       |
| 50%       | Used to buy-back-and-burn TeenDACC |

Every week the team will use 50% of the royalty fees to buy TeenDACC off the secondary markets and burn them, permanently reducing the total supply of the TeenDACC collection.

When the 7777 original supply of TeenDACC has been reduced to 3000. The burning mechanism will cease, and the 50% portion of the TeenDACC royalty fee will be used for future development.

From the interest generated by the [Investment Vault](the-investment-vault.md) a 5% portion will be held back and used to speed up the TeenDACC buy-back-and-burn process, once this goal of reducing the total supply of TeenDACC to 3000 has been reached then this 5% portion of the interest will be used for future development.

The other 50% portion of the TeenDACC royalty fee will be sent to the investment vault to help grow the principle. Once the investment vault reaches a total combined value of USD $300,000+ we will cease to add new investment funds to the vault. At that time this 50% portion of the royalty fee will no longer be sent to the investment vault, and instead, it will be used for future development.\
