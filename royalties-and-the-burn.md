# ðŸ”¥ Royalties and the Burn

The TeenDACC NFT will have a 10% secondary market royalty fee.

This fee will be allocated as follows:

| Royalties | Allocation                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 50%       | Sent to the Investment Vault       |
| 50%       | Used to buy-back-and-burn TeenDACC |

Every week the team will use 50% of the royalty fees to buy TeenDACC off the secondary markets and burn them, permanently reducing the total supply of the TeenDACC collection.

When the 7777 original supply of TeenDACC has been reduced to 3000. The burning mechanism will cease, and the 50% portion of the TeenDACC royalty fee will be re-assigned as agreed by the DACC council.

The other 50% portion of the TeenDACC royalty fee will be sent to the investment vault to help grow the principle. Once the investment vault reaches a total combined value of USD $200,000+ we will cease to add new investment funds to the vault. At that time this 50% will be re-assigned as agreed by the DACC council.  \
