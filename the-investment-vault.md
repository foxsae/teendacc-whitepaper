# üóù The Investment Vault

From the pooled together resources generated by the TeenDACC mint: 65% will be placed into an investment portfolio which we call the "Investment Vault".

This portfolio will pay out a portion of the interest it earns in Cro tokens to NFT holders, and it will also continue to reinvest a portion of the interest that it earns so that the principal value of the Investment Vault will continue to grow over time.
