# üóù The Investment Vault

From the pooled together resources generated by the TeenDACC mint: 65% will be placed into an investment portfolio which we call the "Investment Vault".&#x20;

This portfolio will pay out a portion of the interest it earns in Candy-token and Cros-token to staked NFT holders, and it will also continue to reinvest a portion of the interest that it earns in those tokens so that the principal value of the Investment Vault will continue to grow over time.

It is estimated that the size of the TeenDACC Investment Vault will be worth approximately 880,000 Cro when the mint is complete.
