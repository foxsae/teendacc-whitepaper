# üóù The Investment Vault

From the pooled together resources generated by the TeenDACC mint: 65% will be placed into an investment portfolio which we call the "Investment Vault" which will be controlled by a **multi-sig wallet** so that no single person will have complete control of the funds.

This portfolio will pay out a portion of the interest it earns in Candy-token and Cros-token to staked NFT holders, and it will also continue to reinvest a portion of the interest that it earns in those tokens so that the principal value of the Investment Vault will continue to grow over time.

It is estimated that the size of the TeenDACC Investment Vault will be worth approximately 440,000 Cro when the mint is complete.

## Multi-Sig Wallet

The funds will be kept in a multi-sig wallet, which will have 3 signing authorities, and every transaction will require at least 2 signatures. This ensures that no single person will have complete control or complete access to the funds.&#x20;

## Investment Allocations

## 85% Liquidity pools

## 10% NFTs

## 5% Experimental&#x20;
